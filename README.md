# NycNewSpots

Welcome to NYC New Spots application. This application gives you information from eater.com about the new, hot restaurants in New York City. You will receive a list of them that includes their name, food type, address and phone number. By entering a name of a restaurant into the program, you will recieve a small paragraph about the restaurant. 

In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/nyc_new_spots`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.
